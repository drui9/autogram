## Installation :: Python3
`pip install autogram`

## `An efficient asyncronous Telegram bot API wrapper!`
Autogram is a telegram BOT API wrapper with focus on simplicity and performance.

## `Why AutoGram?`
I need a bot framework that makes it easy to administer control remotely.

## `Project TODOs`
- Plans to cover the entire telegram API methods.

### `footnotes`
- `Polling` can be implemented by the user, while feeding data to the bot through `bot.parseUpdate(...)`
- Don't run multiple bots with the same `TOKEN` as this will cause update problems
- Sending unescaped special characters when using MarkdownV2 will return HTTP400
- Have `fun` with whatever you're building `;)`
